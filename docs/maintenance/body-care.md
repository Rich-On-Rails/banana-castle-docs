It is important that the body work of the engine is maintained regularly, this will stop the paint from becoming damaged over time and also ensure that the body is free from dirt and grime that will ultimately cause corrosion and damage to the paint. 

### WD40

WD40 can be used directly on the loco after use, this will assist with removing any grime from the paint work, once the initial cleaning is complete a dry rag should be used to clean the loco's body work and ensure that it is free from any oils.
