### Introduction

The battery currently installed in the loco is a *Halfords HB038 Lead Acid 12V Car Battery* available [here](https://www.halfords.com/motoring/batteries/car-batteries/halfords-hb038-lead-acid-12v-car-battery-3-year-guarantee-953034.html)

1A is 1 Amp which could be described as the flow of electricity. The battery used on the loco has a total capacity of 35 Amp Hours which means that when fully charged it can deliver 1 amp for 35 hours or 10 amps for 3.5 etc. 

With the above in mind in theory it will take 35 hours for a 1A charger to fully charge the battery, see the specifications section of this document which shows the recommended charge rate of the battery.
